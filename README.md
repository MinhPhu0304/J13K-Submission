This is my submission to J13K competitions
The game is endless running type but using  only pure Javascript and HTML

  This game used a modified version of Mibbu game engine. Link: http://mibbu.eu/

- **How to Play**:
  - Using arrow keys to move the rocket. Your goal is to avoid as much as meteors as possible.

- **Note**:
  - I will upload a better version of this game later without any contraints about file size
  - You can modify the game in Game folder source code. The source code in Game folder is readable but not the submission folder
